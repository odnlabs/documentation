# API Specs

## Technologies

#### Programming Language

**Rust** is the programming language of choice for our API, for it's performance, safety, ecosystem, and interoperability.

#### Framework

**Axum** is the backend framework we use. Considering it's backed by tokio, we trust it as a reliable and well-maintained framework to use in our ecosystem.

#### Database

**MongoDB** is the database we choose to use, as it provides flexibility, it's document oriented, and scalable. Flexibility is important because we won't be 100% sure of the database models we want to use at the beginning.



Other technologies include using JSON as the data format, JWT for authentication, and WebSocket for live connections.
